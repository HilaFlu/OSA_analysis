# OSA_analysis
A tool for the analysis of operant behavior &amp; EtOH operant self administration (OSA), based on MED-PC-IV output files.

MED-PC-IV is a useful software for managing operant behavior tests such as EtOH operant self administration. However, its output file is hard to manage and contains a lot of unorganized data, which makes it hard to utilize and further analyze. 
Our tool is meant to help those who use this software to better manage and analyze their data. You as a user can create you own experiment in the software and add your experimental animals divided by groups to said experiment. When uploading MED-PC-IV output file to our program, all of the data is processed and saved conveniently as a csv for the entire experiment and for each of the animals. Those who do OSA can even use our analysis tool, that automatically generates the common graphs used in such experiments.

Hope you enjoy our tool :)
